# Project : Basics 1


### Task 0. Change your home IP
Write a Bash script that configures an Ubuntu server with the below requirements.

Requirements:

localhost resolves to 127.0.0.2
facebook.com resolves to 8.8.8.8.

If you’re running this script on a machine that you’ll continue to use, be sure to revert localhost to 127.0.0.1. Otherwise, a lot of things will stop working!
